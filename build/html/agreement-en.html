            <h2 align="center">Terms of Service</h2><br/>

            <p align="center">(last updated July 2014)</p>

            <p><strong>1.<u>Acceptance of Terms:<br/></u></strong>Welcome! School Loop, Inc.
                ("School Loop" or "us" or "we") welcomes you to our website at
                <a href="http://www.schoolloop.com/">www.schoolloop.com</a>
                (the "School Loop Site").</p>

            <p>We provide several services. Our website system is used to create publicly
                accessible web pages. School Loop Plus is a school-to-home communication and
                collaboration service that helps teachers, students, school staff, and parents
                share information about student homework assignments, grades, and other
                school-related information. OnTrackEDU is a social dashboard system that helps
                education professionals support students and lead effective schools. We refer to
                our online applications and our website together as the "Service," and all the
                different types of people who have accounts on the services as "Users."</p>

            <p>By using or accessing any part of the Service, you are agreeing to these Terms
                of Service and all other policies or notices posted by us on our website.</p>

            <p>If you don't agree to these Terms of Service, please don't use the Service. We
                can change these Terms of Service at any time. If we make any changes, we will note
                that changes to the Terms of Service have been made in the "news" that we publish
                as part of the Service. Thereafter, it will be your responsibility to review the
                new Terms of Service to see if you agree with the new terms as it creates a binding
                legal agreement between you and School Loop. If you use the Service after we've
                changed any of the Terms of Service, you are agreeing to all of the changes. Again,
                if you do not agree, please don't use the Service.</p>

            <p><strong>2.<u>Permission to Use the Service</u></strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>You have our permission to use the Service, but only if:</li>

                <li>you have the permission of your school or school district to do so (each
                    school or district sets its own policies on use of the Service, so you should ask
                    your school about the conditions for becoming a user of the Service and whether
                    any approval is required for special rights, like viewing grades);
                </li>

                <li>you are using the Service for your own personal school-related purposes and
                    not for commercial purposes;
                </li>

                <li>you do not copy the Service or any part of the Service;</li>

                <li>you do not modify the Service or any part of the Service;</li>

                <li>you follow all the rules and restrictions we've spelled out in these Terms of
                    Service.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>3.<u>Accounts; Passwords; Security</u></strong><br/>
                You will need an account in order to use the Service. You may not use someone
                else's account without permission. When you are setting up your account, you must
                give us accurate and complete information. This means that you cannot set up an
                account using someone else's name or contact information, or a phony name or phony
                contact information. You have complete responsibility for your account and
                everything that happens on your account. This means you need to be careful with
                your password. If you find out that someone is using your account without your
                permission, you must let us know immediately. We are not liable for any damages or
                losses caused by someone using your account without your permission. If you are not
                an employee of a school district, and we (or anyone else) suffer any damage due to
                the unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable. If you are an employee of
                a school district, your personal liability is the same as with any other
                school-related activity. That liability is defined by your district. We can
                terminate your account at any time without notice to you.</p>

            <p><strong>4. <u>Personal Use Only</u></strong><br/>
                We are making the Service available to you for your information and your personal
                school-related use only. You may not (and you agree not to) use, copy, distribute,
                transmit, broadcast, sell, or do anything else with the Service for any other
                purpose.</p>

            <p>If you are a student or a parent, you may electronically copy and print, in hard
                copy form, information made available by the Service for the sole purpose of
                reviewing your (or your child's) personal school data, school notices, school
                homework assignments, or any other documents posted to the Service for your use.
                Any other use of materials on this Service, including reproduction for purposes
                other than those noted above, modification, distribution, or re-publication,
                without the prior written permission of School Loop or the applicable teacher or
                school administrator is strictly prohibited.</p>

            <p>We reserve the right to discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time.</p>

            <p><strong>5.<u>Intellectual Property Rights in User Content</u></strong><br/>
                You are solely responsible for any User Content you post to the Service, and the
                consequences of posting or publishing it. By "User Content", we mean any Content
                you post to the Service. "Content" means information, data, text, graphics,
                messages, interactive features, grade data, absence data, or any other materials.
                Examples of User Content are teaching materials prepared by teachers, homework
                turned in by students, and e-mail messages among students, teachers, parents, and
                school administrators. These are just a few examples and are not meant to limit
                what we mean by User Content. When we say "post", we include posting, uploading,
                sharing, submitting or otherwise providing User Content in any manner in connection
                with the Service.</p>

            <p>If you post User Content, you are making a guarantee to us that you either own
                all the Content you are posting, or you have the right to post the Content.
                Furthermore, you are guaranteeing that you have the right to allow us to make your
                User Content available for others to view and use as part of the Service (subject
                to the privacy restrictions in the Service). If you do not have these rights, do
                not post the Content. <b>By posting your User Content, you do not lose any
                    ownership rights you may have to it</b>. However, you do grant us a worldwide,
                non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use,
                reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform your User
                Content only in connection with the Service.</p>

            <p>This grant includes the right to aggregate your User Content with other User
                Content for the purpose of compiling information regarding users of the Service as
                a whole.? For example, the Service may include a search engine that returns search
                results based on the number of times that teachers and administrators have posted
                links to these sites in the Service.? In order to provide this search engine,
                School Loop must aggregate information regarding the links that teachers and
                administrators have posted and the context in which the links were posted (such as
                assignments, courses, grade level, etc.).? In aggregating this information, unless
                you permit us to identify you, School Loop will remove any personally identifying
                information, such as who posted the link.</p>

            <p>You also grant each user of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your
                User Content through the Service and to use, copy, print, distribute, display and
                perform your User Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service
                (subject to the privacy restrictions in the Service and any copyright notices you
                include in your User Content) and under these Terms of Service. Once you remove
                your User Content from the Service (which you have the right to do at any time),
                these licenses will no longer apply. The only exception is that if someone made or
                distributed a copy of your User Content while it was still on the Service, that
                person will still be allowed to use the copy.</p>

            <p><strong>6. <u>Some User Content You Share May Become Public</u></strong><br/>
                Some users of the Service may use the Service to host forums for online discussion
                or message posting about issues important to your community or school. The
                organizer of the forum will determine how these online forums are used. These are
                public forums, and information that users post may be available to other members of
                the school community, and in some cases even other schools or on the Internet. Your
                individual school will decide how it wishes to use online discussion and message
                boards.</p>

            <p>In addition, the Service allows your individual district or school to make
                certain information that you post available on the internet. Your individual
                district or school will decide what kinds of information to make public on the
                Internet, but this information may include information posted by teachers about
                their course descriptions, syllabi, and assignments, as well as general information
                about the school, school news and school events. Your individual school or school
                district is responsible for ensuring that its decision regarding the information it
                makes available on the Internet is consistent with its own privacy policies and
                applicable law.</p>

            <p>If you are a parent, you agree that the practices described in this Section 6
                are acceptable to you, as well as to any of your children that use the Service. If
                you are a teacher, you agree that the practices described in this Section 6 are
                acceptable to you as well as any of your students that use the Service.</p>

            <p><strong>7. <u>Restrictions on User Content and Your Conduct</u></strong><br/>
                You may not: (i) use our Service for any illegal purpose;</p>

            <p>(ii) use our Service to harm minors in any way, including posting User Content

            <p>(iii) submit User Content that you don't have the right to submit, unless you
                have the owner's permission; this includes someone else's private information (such
                as passwords, home addresses, personal phone numbers), as well as material covered
                by someone else's copyright, trade secret, privacy, publicity, or any other
                proprietary right;</p>

            <p>(iv)publish or distribute pictures of others or yourself without appropriate
                permission;</p>

                origin of any User Content you submit;</p>

            <p>(vi) submit any User Content that contains lies, falsehoods or
                misrepresentations that could damage us or anyone else;</p>

            <p>(vii) submit User Content that is illegal, obscene, defamatory, libelous,
                threatening, pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or
                encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil
                liability, violate any law, or is otherwise inappropriate;</p>

            <p>(viii) transmit any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional
                materials, junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or any other form of
                solicitation;</p>

            <p>(x)use meta tags or any other "hidden text" utilizing any of our or our
                suppliers' product names or trademarks;</p>

            <p>(xi) upload, launch, post, email or transmit any material (including any bot,
                worm, scripting exploit or computer virus) that is likely to harm or corrupt our
                Service, or harm or corrupt our or anyone else's computer systems, or data;</p>

            <p>(xii) collect or gather other people's personal information (including account
                information) from our Service;</p>

            <p>(xiii) submit User Content which disparages or our partners, vendor or
                affiliates; or</p>

            <p>(xiv) solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of our Service.</p>

            <p>We have the sole right, but not necessarily the obligation, to delete at any
                time any User Content that violates these rules or that we believe to be
                inappropriate for any reason. Furthermore, if you violate any of these rules, we
                may terminate your account and access to the Service and take any other action
                against you that we think is necessary.</p>

            <p><strong>8. <u>We Are Not Responsible for User Content</u></strong><br/>
                We generally do not review any of the User Content posted by our users. We do not
                endorse any User Content or support any views, opinions, recommendations, or advice
                that may be in user submissions. User Content comes from a variety of sources, and
                we make no promises about the reliability of any source or the accuracy,
                usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of any user submission. You may
                be offended by User Content that you see on the Service. You may find some of it to
                be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. However, you agree not to
                hold us responsible in any way for your use of our Service, including your exposure
                to User Content.</p>

            <p><strong>9. <u>Proprietary Rights</u></strong><br/>
                School Loop and its suppliers retain all right, title and interest (including all
                copyright, trade secret, patent and other rights) in and to the Service (including
                its interface and any underlying software or technology) and Content which is
                included in the Service (other than User Content). We reserve all rights in and to
                the Service unless we expressly state otherwise. The Service contains proprietary
                and confidential information that is protected by applicable intellectual property
                and other laws.</p>

            <p>The Service may include text, images, and other Content of School Loop or
                third-parties ("Licensed Content") which you are permitted to use in connection
                with the Service; you may use such Licensed Content only in connection with use of
                the Service and only as expressly permitted and you may not otherwise remove, copy,
                use or distribute any such Licensed Content apart from the Service.</p>

            <p>You may not decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or otherwise reduce the
                Service to a human-perceivable form, except and only to the extent that such
                activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation.
                You may not modify, sell, rent, lend, lease, transfer, resell for profit,
                distribute or create derivative works based upon the Service.</p>

            <p>All brand, product and service names used in the Service which identify School
                Loop or its suppliers and their proprietary products and services are the
                trademarks or service marks of School Loop or its suppliers. Nothing in this
                Service shall be deemed to confer on any person any license or right on the part of
                School Loop or such supplier with respect to any such image, logo or name.</p>

            <p><strong>10. <u>Keeping Copyright Notices and Security Features
                Intact</u></strong><br/>
                If you download or share a copy of anything on or created using the Service, you
                must not delete, erase, or remove any logos or notices (such as copyright notices)
                that are on the item you download. You also understand that certain items may not
                be reprinted without the permission of the author. Similarly, you agree not to
                disable, interfere, or try to get around any of the features of the Service related
                to security, preventing or restricting use or copying of any Content, or enforcing
                the limits on the use of the Service or the Content on the Service.</p>

            <p><strong>11. <u>Enforcement of Copyrights</u></strong><u><br/></u>We respect the
                intellectual property rights of others. You may not use our Service to infringe
                anyone else's copyright or other intellectual property right. If we find out that
                you are infringing, we will remove your User Content. We do not have to give you
                notice that we are removing your User Content. We may also terminate your account
                if we decide that you are a repeat infringer. We consider a repeat infringer to be
                a user who has been notified of infringing activity more than twice or who has had
                User Content removed from our Service more than twice.</p>

            <p><strong>12. <u>Notify Us of Infringers</u></strong><br/>

            <p>(v) provide a statement that you believe in good faith that the item you have
                identified as infringing is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or
                the law to be used on our Service; and</p>

            <p>(vi) provide a statement that the information you provide in your notice is
                accurate, and that (under penalty of perjury), you are authorized to act on behalf

            <p><strong>14. <u>Our Storage Policy</u></strong><br/>
                School Loop offers "digital lockers" as part of the Service. We will store the
                information you place in your locker for as long as you have a valid account and
                meet the requirements for using the Service as determined by your school.
                Thereafter, we will remove the contents from your digital locker. For example, if
                you are a teacher and you leave your employment with your school, you will lose
                your locker contents. Similarly, if you are a student and you no longer have a
                schedule assigned to you while school is in session, you will lose your contents.
                Please note that even though we make digital lockers available to you, you are
                solely responsible for keeping back-ups of everything you post on our Service.
                Note, if you are connected to Google Drive via your School Loop locker &ndash; your
                Drive content will not be affected if your School Loop account is no longer
                active.</p>

            <p><strong>15. <u>FERPA</u><br/></strong> Please be aware that the Service and all
                User Content may be subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
                (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99). FERPA is a Federal law that applies to
                student education records. Here is a very brief summary of the key elements of
                FERPA, as excerpted from the U.S. Department of Education website at
                <a href="http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html"
                   target="_blank">http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html</a>:
            </p>

            <p>FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education
                records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18
                or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have
                transferred are "eligible students."</p>

            <p>Parents or eligible students have the right to inspect and review the student's
                education records maintained by the school. Schools are not required to provide
                copies of records unless, for reasons such as great distance, it is impossible for
                parents or eligible students to review the records. Schools may charge a fee for
                copies.</p>

            <p>Parents or eligible students have the right to request that a school correct
                records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If the school decides
                not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student then has the right to a
                formal hearing. After the hearing, if the school still decides not to amend the
                record, the parent or eligible student has the right to place a statement with the
                record setting forth his or her view about the contested information.</p>

            <p>Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible
                student in order to release any information from a student's education record.
                However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the
                following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR 99.31):</p>

                        interest;

                        issued subpoena;

                </ul>
            </div>
            Schools may disclose, without consent, "directory" information such as a
            student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and
            awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and eligible
            students about directory information and allow parents and eligible students a
            reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose directory
            information about them. For example, a student given publishing rights by a
            webmaster at a school may publish news and events to the school website. Those
            items display the student's name as the publisher of the item on the site. Schools
            must notify parents and eligible students annually of their rights under FERPA. The
            actual means of notification (special letter, inclusion in a PTA bulletin, student
            handbook, or newspaper article) is left to the discretion of each school. More
            information about FERPA is available on the U.S. Department of Education website at
            <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">www.ed.gov</a>.

            <p><strong>16. <u>Links to Other Sites:</u></strong><br/>
                Our Service may contain links to other websites that we don't own or control. We
                are not responsible for any of these other websites. You will not hold us
                responsible for any aspect of these other websites, including their content,
                privacy policies, or anything else. You may be exposed to things on other websites
                that you don't like or that you find offensive. We are not responsible for this,

            <p><strong>17. <u>Third Party Integration</u><br/></strong> By enabling any third
                party services (e.g. choosing to connect to and access Google Drive, a third party
                service, through your School Loop locker), you agree that School Loop is not
                responsible for the accuracy, legality, availability or reliability of any such
                third party services, the acts or omissions of any providers of such third party
                services or any information made available in connection with such third party
                services. Please remember that the manner in which such third party services use,
                store and disclose your information is governed solely by the policies of such
                third parties, and School Loop will have no liability or responsibility for the
                privacy practices or other actions of any provider of such third party service. As
                such, you agree not to seek to hold School Loop liable or responsible for any
                damage or loss caused by or in connection with the use of such third party
                services. School Loop enables these features merely as a convenience and the
                integration or inclusion of such features does not imply an endorsement or

            EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU
            MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS, WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.

            <p><strong>19. <u>Limitation of Liability</u></strong><br/>
                TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LAW, SCHOOL LOOP AND ITS AFFILIATES,
                SUPPLIERS AND PARTNERS HAVE NO OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY (WHETHER ARISING IN

                FOR ANY direct, indirect, INCIDENTAL, special, punitive, or CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
                OR LIABILITIES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY LOSS OF DATA, REVENUE OR PROFIT)
                ARISING from or related to YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR any content provideD BY OR

                SERVICE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL,
                CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER TYPES OF DAMAGES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT
                APPLY TO YOU.</p>

            <p><strong>20. <u>Indemnity</u></strong><br/>
                You agree to indemnify and hold harmless School Loop and its affiliates, suppliers,
                partners, officers, agents, and employees from and against any claim, demand,
                losses, damages or expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising from
                your violation of these Terms of Service, your violation of any rights of any
                third-party or arising solely from your negligence or willful misconduct. Your
                indemnification obligation will survive these Terms of Service and your use of the
                Service.</p>

            <p><strong>21. <u>Termination</u></strong><br/>
                We may terminate your permission to use the Service immediately and without notice
                upon any violation of these Terms of Service, your failure to pay any fees (if
                applicable) when due, upon the request of law enforcement or government agencies,
                for extended periods of inactivity, for unexpected technical issues or problems or
                for engagement by you in fraudulent or illegal activities. If we terminate your use
                of the Service for any of these reasons or otherwise for cause, we will not refund
                any fees you may have paid (including any fees you have pre-paid for ongoing use of
                the Service).</p>We may terminate or suspend the Service or any part of the Service
            or your use of the Service, at any time without cause without any liability to you.
            We may also report any violation of these Terms of Service, including any violation
            with respect to User Content, to your school and remove any of your User Content as
            directed by your school, without any liability to you. If we terminate your use of
            the Service without cause, we will provide a pro-rata refund for any period of the
            Services for which you paid fees in advance but which you will not be able to use
            due to the termination. Upon any termination we may delete your account, passwords
            and User Content and bar you from further use of the Service. You agree that we
            will have no liability to you or any third party for termination of your account,
            User Content or access to the Service.

            <p><strong>22. <u>General Terms</u></strong><br/>
                These Terms of Service are governed by laws of the state of California, without
                respect to its conflict of laws principles. The sole jurisdiction and venue for any
                claim arising from the Service and these Terms of Service shall be the state and
                federal courts located in, or serving, San Mateo County, California and each party
                hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts. These Terms
                of Service, together with any other legal notices we have published on the Service,
                constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding this Service. If a
                court having proper authority decides that any portion of these Terms of Service is
                invalid, only the part that is invalid will not apply. The rest of these Terms of
                Service will still be in effect. If we waive any of our rights under these Terms
                and Conditions in any particular instance, it does not mean that we are waiving our
                rights generally or in the future. Furthermore, just because we may not enforce all
                our rights all of the time, it does not mean that we are waiving our rights. We may
                decide to enforce them at a later date. These Terms of Service, and any rights and
                licenses granted under these Terms of Service, may not be transferred or assigned
                by you, but may be assigned by us without restriction.</p>

            <p>
                YOU AGREE THAT if you
                want to sue us, you must file your lawsuit within 1 year after the event that gave
                rise to your lawsuit. OTHERWISE, your lawsuit will be PERMANENTLY BARRED.
